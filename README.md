# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview
Using several Google Maps APIs, this project focused on retrieving data from cities across the world. The data captured included city name, country, hotels, location (latitude and longitude), and weather conditions (maximum temperature, wind speed, cloudiness, humidity, and other general descriptions of current weather). This data was tested based on user preference for location and temperature, and then sorted into potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Sample itineraries were mapped using Google Maps Directions API to display travel routes between several cities as well as a marker layer map with stored information about the hotel name, city name, country, maximum temperature, and current weather.
